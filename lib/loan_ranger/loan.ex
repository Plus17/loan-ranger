  Create loan struct.


  You need to pass monetary values â€‹â€‹as a positive integer that represents how much in the smallest currency
  unit (for example, 100 cents to $ 1.00).
  You can specify the currency with the argument opts. LoanRanger works with [Money library](https://github.com/elixirmoney/money).
  The default currency is USD.

  ## Example
  ```
  params = %{
    loan_amount: 8_500_000,
    annual_interest_rate: "60.0",
    payment_amount: 759_500,
    opening_date: "2018-12-28",
    term: 18,
   }

  opts = [currency: :USD]

  iex > LoanRanger.Loan.create(params, opts)
  {:ok,
    %LoanRanger.Loan{
      loan_amount: %Money{amount: 8500000, currency: :USD},
      annual_interest_rate: #Decimal<60.0>,
      payment_amount: %Money{amount: 759500, currency: :USD},
      opening_date: ~D[2018-12-28],
      term: 18
